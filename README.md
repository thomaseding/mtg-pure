# mtg-pure
Purely functional Haskell "Magic: The Gathering" card model and game engine.

---

### About:

 This is a showcase of how to make an elegant purely functional "Magic: The Gathering" DSL model and engine. [MtgPure](https://github.com/thomaseding/mtg-pure) is my advancement from a previous Haskell DSL I made years ago for the card game Hearthstone, [Hearthshroud](https://github.com/thomaseding/hearthshroud). While there are superficial similarities between MtgPure and Hearthshroud's encodings, Magic is significantly more complex than Hearthstone. This new encoding is much more refined and generic to handle all sorts of complex and outlier Magic cards.

---

### Model Goals:
- The world's best MTG encoding.
- Pure data modelling of cards as a type-safe DSL.
- Card model is a deep embedding.
- Card model is algebraic and recursive.
- Cards type-check if and only if they are valid cards. (Barring a few exceptions such as bottom(âŠ¥) appearing in card definitions.)
- Card model is expressive enough to replicate its souce code through introspection.
- Cards can be used in arbitrary game formats without change.
- Formal changes to game rules should not require re-modelling cards. (Cards may be rewritten if they get errata.)

---

### Engine Goals:
- Exhaustive and type-checked engine.
- Event-based programmatic control.
- Solitaire CLI. You control all player actions.
- Good for exploring card and game-state interactions.

### Quickstart (FIXME: this is outdated):
```
$ cd src
$ runhaskell MtgPure/Model/ToObjectN/CodeGen.hs > MtgPure/Model/ToObjectN/Instances.hs
$ ghci -hidir .output -odir .output -fobject-code -Wall -Werror -Wno-type-defaults -XDataKinds -XOverloadedStrings -XTypeApplications MtgPure
MtgPure> :i island
island :: Card OTLand   -- Defined in `MtgPure.Cards'
MtgPure> compare island island
EQ
MtgPure> print island
Card "Island" WCardLand $ thisObject @OTLand $ \_this1 -> LandDef [BasicLand Island] []
MtgPure> island == (Card "Island" WCardLand $ thisObject @OTLand $ \_this1 -> LandDef [BasicLand Island] [])
True
MtgPure> island == (Card "Island" WCardLand $ thisObject @OTLand $ \_this1 -> LandDef [BasicLand Mountain] [])
False
MtgPure> Card "WontCompile1" WCardLand $ thisObject @OTCreature $ \_this1 -> LandDef [BasicLand Island] []
<interactive>: error: * Couldn't match type 'OTCreature with 'OTLand
MtgPure> Card "WontCompile2" WCardLand $ thisObject @OTLand $ \this -> LandDef [] [effect $ DrawCards this 1]
<interactive>: error: * Couldn't match type 'OTLand with 'OTPlayer
```
Notes:
 - Setting `-Wno-type-defaults` so the `Show` instances for cards don't need to constantly specify `Num` types when `Integer` is good enough for authoring. (Too much noise adding annotations for `Integer` or even `Int` or an alias `I`.)
 - `src/MtgPure/Model/ToObjectN/Instances.hs` is a multi-megabyte file and will take a while to compile, hence the `-fobject-code` flag to cache the result. It is recommended you don't open this file with the Haskell Language Server active unless you want to max out and throttle your computer's RAM.

### Contributors:
At this point, I am very unlikely to accept contributions unless I know you and we discussed ahead of time.

### Low priority:
- AI
- GUI

---

### Will not fix issues related to:
- Handling of integer overflow. I don't want to use unbounded integer types, and I'm okay with deviating from official MTG rules here.

---

### Haskell language options:
- Safe
- NoIncoherentInstances
- NoOverlappingInstances (todo: write a script that generates non-overlapping ToManaCost/ToManaPool instances needed to achieve this)
- NoTemplateHaskell
- NoUndecidableInstances
